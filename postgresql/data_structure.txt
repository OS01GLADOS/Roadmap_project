why to use schema:
 - To allow many users to use one database without interfering with each other.
 - To organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.
 - Third-party applications can be put into separate schemas so they do not collide with the names of other objects.

	CREATE SCHEMA myschema;

To drop a schema if it's empty (all objects in it have been dropped), use:

	DROP SCHEMA myschema;

To drop a schema including all contained objects, use:

	DROP SCHEMA myschema CASCADE;

Often you will want to create a schema owned by someone else (since this is one of the ways to restrict the activities of your users to well-defined namespaces). The syntax for that is:

CREATE SCHEMA schema_name AUTHORIZATION user_name;

You can even omit the schema name, in which case the schema name will be the same as the user name.
